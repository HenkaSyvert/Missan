colliders
	rotate colliders and bounding boxes
	fix interdependent dimension properties (min, max, size, extents)
	fix types: sphere, box, capsule, mesh
	make collider radius work with transform scale
	fix so can offset collider from transform origin with collider.center

transform
	quaternions for rotation
	children
	translate, rotate, lookat
	local v world space

graphics
	texture mip map
	look at unity legacy shaders for insp
	line/wireframe renderer


rigidbody:
	set density based on collider volume and mass, on assummed constant density
	restitution (or bounciness), but maybe handled by separate physics material. 
	fix inertia tensors for asymmetrical and composite colliders. 

engine
	add python bindings

mouse
	add select obj functionality

camera
	render to texture. 
	fix screen space normalization

light
	add directional, spot, point types

texture
	make it support both rgb and rgba
