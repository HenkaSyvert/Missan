physics:
	transform:
		add support f child
	line/wireframe renderer
	rigidbody:
		set density based on collider volume and mass, on assummed constant density
		restitution (or bounciness), but maybe handled by separate physics material. 


prerequisties for improving physics:
	sphere mesh
		func to generate?
	draw wireframe for cube and sphere
		wire frame renderer?
	draw lines, to visualise vectors
		line renderer?
